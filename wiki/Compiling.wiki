#summary How to compile HeeksCNC for Windows

= Introduction =

This is just for Windows for now.


= Details =

You need HeeksCAD ( see http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/ ), because HeeksCNC is an add-in for HeeksCAD.

Check-out all the HeeksCNC files to a folder called "HeeksCNC" ( it has to have this name at the moment ) under the HeeksCAD folder that you checked-out the heekscad project to.

Open "HeeksCNC.sln"

Press "Build Solution"

Install the latest verion of Python, ( HeeksCNC uses Python scripts extensively )

Run HeeksCAD.exe and it should load up HeeksCNC.dll and add the extra windows and menu items.
