#summary How to compile HeeksCNC for Windows

= Introduction =

This is just for Windows for now.


= Details =

You need to a lot of the things that are needed for HeeksCAD ( see http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/ ), because HeeksCNC is and add-in for HeeksCAD.

I used Windows XP.

Get Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition ( it's free ).

Download the wxWidgets installation.

Set an environment variable called WXWIN to be C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7 or whereever wxWidgets installed to. ( to set an evironment variable go to Control Panel, then System, then Advanced tab, then press "Environment Variables" button, then press "New" ).

Edit C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\include\wx\msw\setup.h
changing "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 0" to "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1"
and changing "#define wxUSE_ODBC 0" to "#define wxUSE_ODBC 1"

Open and build C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\build\msw\wx_dll.dsw ( let VC2008 convert the projects )

Copy all the dlls that get made ( 20 of them named wxXXXX_vc_custom.dll ) from C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\lib\vc_dll to HeeksCAD ( the folder you checked out HeeksCAD to ).

Check-out all the HeeksCNC files to a folder called "HeeksCNC" ( it has to have this name at the moment ) at the same level as the HeeksCAD folder that you checked-out the heekscad project to.

Open "HeeksCNC.sln"

Press Build.

Un-comment the line relevant line in HeeksCAD/AddIns.txt that tells HeeksCAD to load up HeeksCNC.dll

Run HeeksCAD.exe and it should load up HeeksCNC.dll and add the extra windows and menu items.
