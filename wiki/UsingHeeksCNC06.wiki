#summary Using HeeksCNC 0.6

= Not all implemented yet =

HeeksCNC is a graphical user interface, built using HeeksCAD
It allows the user to define an NC program using objects with graphical icons.
The user can edit the properties of these.

A Python script program file is then automatically made from this.

This is then converted to NC code for the user's machine tool with some machine-specific Python script.

The NC code is then backplotted ( yet more Python script ), so the toolpath can be shown in the graphics window of HeeksCNC. 

If the user edits the NC file, these edits can not be passed back up to the Python program.
If the user edits the Python program, these edits can not be passed back up to the graphical objects.
